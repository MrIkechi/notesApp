# The Note App

this is a first attempt at creating a website using HTML, Python and Bootstrap.
The idea and first execution take off from the work of Tech with Tim: https://youtu.be/dam0GPOAvVI

## main.py
runs the app

## templates 
is a folder that holds the HTML templates for the app


## auth.py
this has the authentication information


## models.py
models for the database; the structure of the database


The rest of the code is quite self-explanatory
